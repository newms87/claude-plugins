#
# Bring every installed Claude Code plugin on this machine up to the version
# its marketplace currently advertises.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Claude Code's built-in plugin auto-update is disabled in this environment:
# the desktop app launches its CLI with DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1, which the docs
# state disables automatic updates "for both Claude Code and all plugins".
# `autoUpdate: true` on the marketplace entry never gets a chance to run.
#
# The visible symptom is nasty precisely because nothing errors: plugin
# versions are recorded PER PROJECT in ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json,
# so one project silently keeps loading months-old skills, rules and hooks
# while another project on the same machine runs current ones. Sessions look
# healthy the whole time. This machine sat on base v0.3.15 (June 9) in one
# project and v0.3.27 in another before anyone noticed.
#
# See also: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/52218 — even with
# auto-update working, Claude Code may promote a plugin's runtime version
# without rewriting installed_plugins.json, leaving plugin-bundled HOOKS
# pinned to the stale installPath. Driving `claude plugin update` directly, as
# this script does, rewrites the record and so is immune to that bug.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
# ------------
#   1. Fast-forwards every marketplace clone under ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/
#      (Claude Code's own background refresh does not reliably git-pull these).
#   2. Runs `claude plugin update <plugin> --scope <scope>` once per installed
#      row, from that row's project directory, so project-scoped installs
#      resolve to the right project.
#
# Version comparison is deliberately NOT reimplemented here — the CLI already
# owns that logic and skips a plugin that is current. Running it per row is
# idempotent.
#
# Updates apply to the NEXT session; a running session keeps the versions it
# loaded at launch. That is Claude Code's own model, not a limitation of this
# script.
#
# USAGE
# -----
#   ./scripts/update-plugins.sh [--dry-run] [--quiet]
#
#   --dry-run          Report what would be updated; run no update, pull no clone.
#   --quiet            Suppress per-row progress; print only summary and errors.
#   --throttle <secs>  Exit 0 immediately if a run finished less than <secs>
#                      ago. For the SessionStart hook, so opening ten sessions
#                      an hour does not mean ten full update sweeps.
#
# Concurrent runs are serialized by a lock: a second invocation while one is
# running exits 0 without doing anything, rather than racing the first one's
# rewrite of installed_plugins.json.
#
# Exit status is 0 only when every row updated or was already current. A row
# that fails — including a plugin its marketplace no longer lists — exits 1
# and names the row, rather than being swallowed as "nothing to do".

# The row extraction needs a JSON parser, and WHICH ONE is a host question.
# Probe by RUNNING each candidate, never by `command -v`: on Windows, `python3`
# resolves to a Microsoft Store alias that exists on PATH and then refuses to
# run, so a presence check reports an interpreter that cannot parse anything.
# Node is tried first — it is the runtime this ecosystem already assumes.
#
# Neither available is a HARD failure that names the real cause. The previous
# version simply got no rows out of the process substitution and reported
# "No plugin rows found — nothing to update", which reads as "your records are
# empty" on a machine holding fifteen of them: the publish looks finished while
# every project stays pinned to the old version. That is the exact failure this
# script exists to prevent.
