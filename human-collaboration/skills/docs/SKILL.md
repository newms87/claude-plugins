# Diagnose, Then Fix (Never Add a Skill)

Triggered when the operator flags something done wrong. Stop other work.

## 1. Explain first (read-only)

- **What:** one line, the wrong action.
- **Why:** one or two lines, the reasoning that produced it.

No code edits, no investigation in the project codebase yet.

## 2. Resolve with the ladder, in order

1. **Missing context** (agent didn't know a needed fact) → expand the documentation
   agents reference. Never a rule or skill change.
2. **No rule exists for this behaviour** → add it briefly to the existing skill, rule,
   hook, or MCP tool description that owns the subject. Read every related item first so
   nothing is duplicated.
3. **The rule exists and was still broken** → sharpen it with one concise, generalised
   example. Never a bullet list of cases.
4. **Text can't fix it** → say so and escalate to the operator with a proposed system
   change (MCP tool response reminder, the janitor, or code) instead of more prose.

**Never create a new skill.** A persisting bad behaviour is cheaper than another skill
nobody needed — that habit is what bloated this plugin set before.

## 3. Locate the target and edit it

Fix the surface that actually produced the behaviour — a loaded skill body, an injected
description/frontmatter, a hook, or an MCP tool's response text. If the failure came from
a description/frontmatter, fix that, not just the body.

Resolve the plugin source checkout (never `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, read-only) by
remote, not by guessing a path: check `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` first,
then search sibling repos by `git remote get-url origin`. Use what you find; never clone
a second copy.

- Reaches every project, machine, dispatched context → plugin source.
- This machine's main session only → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- One repo only → that repo's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/rules/`.

Apply the edit yourself (`Edit`/`Write`). A plugin edit isn't done until published: bump
the version and push (`scripts/publish.sh` if present) — publishing is standing,
pre-authorized, never needs approval.

## 4. End state

Every run ends in exactly one of two states — say which:
- **Resolved:** name the file and the brief edit (or doc expansion) made and published.
- **Escalated:** name the proposed system change and ask the operator to confirm it.
