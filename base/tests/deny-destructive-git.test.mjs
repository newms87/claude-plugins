// base deny-destructive-git hook — DX-3094.
//
// DX-3094's root cause: the guard's comment claimed coverage its PATTERN
// regex did not actually have, and nothing compared the two, so the gap was
// silent until an agent's command walked straight through it on 2026-09-21.
//
// This suite does NOT hand-maintain a second list of example commands that
// could itself drift from the script. It reads the `FORM:` / `ALLOWED-FORM:`
// example lines directly OUT OF deny-destructive-git.mjs's own comments (the
// single source of truth — see that file's denylist block) and runs each one
// through the REAL hook as a subprocess. A future editor who documents a new
// covered form without actually implementing it — or the reverse, narrows the
// denylist without updating the comment — makes one of these generated tests
// fail, instead of silently reintroducing DX-3094.
//
// Run with `npm test` (node --test, no dependencies).
