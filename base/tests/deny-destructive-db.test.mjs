// base deny-destructive-db hook — DX-3226.
//
// The bash predecessor shipped with NO test, the only guard in its PreToolUse
// group without one. That is why it spent its whole life refusing
// `grep -rn "DROP DATABASE" .` and `echo "... DROP DATABASE ..."` without
// anyone noticing.
//
// Like its git sibling, this suite does NOT hand-maintain a second list of
// example commands that could drift from the hook. It reads the `FORM:` /
// `ALLOWED-FORM:` lines directly OUT OF deny-destructive-db.mjs's own comments
// and runs each one through the REAL hook as a subprocess, so a bullet that
// claims coverage the code does not have fails here instead of drifting
// silently.
//
// Run with `npm test` (node --test, no dependencies).
