# claude-plugins

Source of truth for the `newms-plugins` marketplace. Every plugin here is consumed by every Claude Code session on this machine — the operator's main sessions, host-mode dispatched workers, and container workers.

## The OPERATING CONTRACT is canon — exactly one copy, and this is where it lives

`base/scripts/operating-contract.sh` holds the operator's four standing principles — orchestrate
by default / never act without verified evidence / validate a proposal by experiment / never
assume when answering the operator. It is wired in `base/hooks/hooks.json` on `SessionStart`
with **no matcher**, so it fires on every source including `compact`, putting the full text back
in context after each compaction. `UserPromptSubmit` gets a one-line pointer, not a second copy.

**Nothing else may restate those four principles** — not a `CLAUDE.md`, not a rule file, not a
`SKILL.md`, not another hook. A skill may only POINT at the contract or EXPAND it with concrete
situation-specific procedure (a mechanical checklist, a worked incident, named commands/tables).
To change a principle, edit that one script and publish `base`. If you find a second copy, delete
it and leave a pointer.

## Hook scripts must never depend on `jq` — it is not installed

Verified 2026-09-05 with a live probe hook: hooks execute under **Git Bash** (`MINGW64_NT`, bash
5.3.15) and `jq` is **absent** from the hook runtime PATH, from PowerShell's PATH, and from WSL.
Every mandate script that piped its text through `jq -n ... additionalContext` therefore emitted
nothing and injected nothing — installed, silent, useless — for as long as it existed on this
machine. All of them were converted to plain stdout on 2026-09-05.

- **To INJECT context:** `printf '%s\n' "$MANDATE"` and `exit 0`. Claude Code adds plain-text
  stdout to the model's context for `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `UserPromptExpansion`
  and `PostModelSwitch` — no JSON envelope needed.
- **To PARSE the stdin payload:** use `node` (it ships with Claude Code), copying the proven
  idiom already in `base/scripts/deny-destructive-git.sh`. Never `jq`.

A hook that fails this way is worse than no hook, because it is trusted: the same absence made
`deny-destructive-db.sh` fail OPEN for its entire life, letting through every command it existed
to block.

## Publishing is TWO steps, and the second one is not optional

A plugin edit is not shipped until BOTH happen:

1. **Bump + push** — `./scripts/publish.sh <patch|minor|major> <plugin>`. The marketplace loader compares `version` fields, not commit shas; a plain `git push` of plugin source ships nothing to any consumer.
2. **Update this machine's installed records** — `update-claude-plugins` (symlink to `scripts/update-plugins.sh`).

Step 2 exists because **installed plugin versions are recorded PER PROJECT** in `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`. Pushing a new version makes it *available*; nothing moves a project's record onto it. Claude Code's own auto-update cannot do it here: the desktop app launches its CLI with `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1`, which the docs state disables automatic updates "for both Claude Code and all plugins".

The failure is silent and uneven, which is why it went unnoticed for two months: the `danxbot` project sat on `base` v0.3.15 (June 9) and `danxbot` v0.3.65 while the `platform` project on the same machine ran v0.3.27 and v0.3.113. Every session looked healthy while loading two-month-old skills, rules, and hooks.

## MANDATORY — run `update-claude-plugins` after ANY plugin push

`publish.sh` already calls it automatically after a successful push, so the normal flow needs no extra command. **Run it by hand whenever a plugin's content reached `origin/main` by any other route:**

- a plain `git push` of plugin source (no bump — fix that first, then update)
- a push from another machine, a dispatched worker, or the GitHub web UI
- a `git pull` that brought someone else's plugin bump into this machine's clone
- any time you are unsure whether this machine's records match `origin/main`

It updates **every plugin in every project on this machine** in one command — there is no per-repo invocation. It is idempotent and skips rows that are already current, so running it when nothing changed costs a few seconds and prints "already current". Running it unnecessarily is free; skipping it leaves projects silently stale.

```bash
update-claude-plugins            # sweep every project on this machine
update-claude-plugins --dry-run  # show what would be checked, change nothing
```

Updates apply to the NEXT session — a running session keeps the versions it loaded at launch. That is Claude Code's own model, not a limitation of the script.

A `SessionStart` hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` also runs it asynchronously with a 6h throttle. Treat that as a backstop, not the mechanism: as of 2026-08-13 the hook is wired but has NOT been observed firing.

## Mechanical pre-action check

Before declaring any plugin work done, answer both:

1. Did `./scripts/publish.sh <bump> <plugin>` run and push? No → the edit is unshipped.
2. Did `update-claude-plugins` run after that push (or did `publish.sh` run it for you)? No → this machine is still loading the old version.

"I'll update later" / "the consumer will pick it up" / "it's only a small edit" are the rationalizations both checks exist to block.
