# Feature Notes — newms-plugins (claude-plugins repo)

Persistent ideator memory for the `claude-plugins` Claude Code plugin marketplace.
Scope: `repo` (this repo only). Board: `claude-plugins:claude-plugins-main` (prefix `CP`).

## What this repo is

A GitHub-distributed Claude Code **plugin marketplace** (`newms-plugins`). Six plugins,
each a directory with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (+ optional
`hooks/hooks.json` and `scripts/*.sh`). Consumers install via marketplace; the marketplace
loader auto-updates a plugin ONLY when its `plugin.json` `version` changes — source edits
without a bump never reach consumers. `scripts/publish.sh` automates the bump+commit+push.

Plugins: `base` (universal discipline), `investigate` (read-only diagnosis), `dev`
(code-writing discipline), `pipeline` (autonomous dev flow), `human-collaboration`
(human-in-loop), `danxbot` (orchestrator domain — 25 skills, the largest).

## Section 1: Feature Inventory

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 6 plugins (base/investigate/dev/pipeline/human-collaboration/danxbot) | Complete | All skills under 300-LOC cap post DX-795 refactor (max 281). |
| `scripts/publish.sh` version-bump automation | Complete | Auto-detects changed plugin trees, bumps semver, commits per-plugin, worktree-aware push (defers to agent-finalize.sh inside agent worktrees). |
| Per-plugin hook mandate system | Complete | SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit/PreToolUse hooks; every referenced `scripts/*.sh` currently resolves. |
| Skill LOC refactor (epic DX-795/796) | Complete | Delivered; matrix + phase-7 report are now stale artifacts (see below). |
| README.md accuracy | **Incomplete** | Lists REMOVED plugins `issues` + `issue-worker` (folded into `danxbot`), OMITS `human-collaboration`. Plugin table + install matrix both wrong. Misleads install. README L12 `pipeline` row also carries stale `flow-*`/"Human-in-loop" wording (fold into this fix). ICE 405 (I5×C9×E9). Carded → CP-5. |
| `dev:git-discipline` mandates dead `/flow-commit` command | **Incomplete** | git-discipline/SKILL.md L48/L50/L159 tell every code-writer to invoke `/flow-commit` — no such command exists; pipeline was renamed `flow-*`→`pipe-*` (real cmd `/pipe-commit`, correct in 12 other refs). Core "never manual git add/commit" rule points at a dead command → agents fall back to the exact manual git it forbids. flow→pipe rename debt = README row (CP-5) + this skill only (grepped; no other dangling flow-* refs). ICE 486 (I6×C9×E9). Carded → CP-44. |
| `deny-destructive-db` docker-volume vector | **Incomplete** | Guard header L18-19 + REASON L44 explicitly promise "recreating the docker volume … will be blocked" but PATTERN L36 has ZERO docker coverage — `docker compose down -v`/`--volumes`, `docker volume rm`/`prune` sail through and destroy the DB volume (same loss as the migrate:fresh incident, which itself ran in docker). Distinct vector from CP-19 (schema APIs) + CP-42 (raw SQL DROP/TRUNCATE); same PATTERN line → implement together. Exclude bare `docker compose down` (legit stop). ICE 448 (I8×C7×E8). Carded → CP-45. |
| Repo integrity validation (manifests / frontmatter / hook-refs / marketplace sources) | **Incomplete** | Nothing validates plugin.json shape+semver, SKILL.md required frontmatter, hook `scripts/*.sh` existence, marketplace `source` dirs, or LOC caps. No CI (`.github/workflows` absent). Broken plugin can ship to all consumers. ICE 336 (I7×C8×E6). Carded → CP-7 Epic / CP-8. |
| Version-bump enforcement | **Incomplete** | README declares the bump MANDATORY but nothing enforces it — a plugin tree can change with a static version and silently never reach consumers (the #1 documented failure mode). No pre-commit hook / CI gate. ICE 240 (I8×C6×E5). Carded → CP-9 (child of CP-7 Epic). |
| Stale root artifacts (`REFACTOR_MATRIX.md` 205L, `REFACTOR_PHASE7_REPORT.md`) | **Removeable** | Completed-epic deliverables, last touched 2026-06-07, cluttering repo root. ICE 243 (I3×C9×E9). Carded → CP-6. |
| `danx-ideate` SKILL card-creation guidance | **Changeable** | SKILL step-2 frames creation as flat `type:'Feature'\|'Bug'` cards with only `ac[]` — contradicts the plugin's own container doctrine (`danx-flesh-out/overview.md`, `issue-card-workflow/phases-epics.md`) and omits that `phase_children[]` is Epic-only (server 400s it on a Feature). Followed literally → bare-Feature defect or 400. ICE 384 (I6×C8×E8). Carded → CP-11. |
| Skill catalog / index | **Incomplete** | 30+ skills across 6 plugins, no single index; no authoring-invariants guide (LOC cap, mandatory bump, frontmatter, hook `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` pattern, no rules/ dir). ICE 210 (I5×C7×E6). Carded → CP-12 Epic (CP-13 generator / CP-14 commit+link / CP-15 authoring guide). |
| `scripts/publish.sh` UX/safety | **Upgradeable** | No `--dry-run` preview (first happy-path action is a commit); no guard against no-op version-only bumps. ICE 196 (I4×C7×E7). Carded → CP-16 Epic (CP-17 dry-run / CP-18 no-op guard). |
| Plugin description drift (README table / marketplace.json / plugin.json) | **Upgradeable** | Three description sources diverge (danxbot marketplace desc detailed vs plugin.json short; README `pipeline` row says stale `flow-*`/"human-in-loop"). README fixes belong to CP-5; marketplace↔plugin.json single-source not yet carded (low value, adjacency to CP-8). ICE 144 (I4×C6×E6). Scratchpad only. |
| `deny-destructive-db.sh` pattern coverage (schema-builder APIs) | **Incomplete** | Header comment (L34-35) + deny REASON claim `dropAllTables/dropAllViews/dropAllTypes` schema-builder APIs are blocked, but the actual regex (L36) blocks only `migrate:fresh/refresh/reset`, `db:wipe`, `DROP DATABASE/SCHEMA`. `Schema::dropAllTables()` passes through — silent bypass of the repo's top data-loss guard. Doc/code drift. ICE 448 (I8×C8×E7). Carded → CP-19. |
| `deny-destructive-db.sh` pattern coverage (raw SQL table drops) | **Incomplete** | SEPARATE vector from CP-19: PATTERN also misses raw `DROP TABLE` / `TRUNCATE` / `psql -c 'DROP TABLE …'` / tinker `DB::statement("DROP TABLE …")`. Rule says "agents NEVER … drop … databases" and the deny REASON literally claims raw psql DROP / TRUNCATE loops "will be blocked" — but they sail through. Exclude bare `DELETE FROM` (legit scoped deletes). Same PATTERN line as CP-19 → implement together. ICE 392 (I8×C7×E7). Carded → CP-42. |
| `inject-time.sh` PostToolUse over-injection | **Upgradeable** | base/hooks.json wires inject-time on PostToolUse → a `<time> +Ns` context line after EVERY tool call. Long danx-next dispatches emit hundreds of `+0/+1s` stamps (token noise); the valuable long-op signal (`+5m` build) is rare. Fix: on PostToolUse, suppress injection unless delta ≥ threshold (~30s); UserPromptSubmit stays unconditional (per-turn stamp). Delta already computed. Sibling to CP-25 in same script. ICE 160 (I4×C5×E8). Carded → CP-43. |
| Retired `danx_issue_create` refs BEYOND CP-34 | **Incomplete** | CP-34 (CP-35 db-reset only) missed FOUR more files still naming the retired create tool `danx_issue_create` (correct = `mcp__danx_dashboard__issue_create`): `issue-card-workflow/references/lifecycle-states.md` L25 (canonical lifecycle ref!), `danx-flesh-out/references/overview.md` L5, `no-false-blockers/SKILL.md` L36, `issue-blocker/SKILL.md` L235. Hard tool-not-found on the create branch. `slack-agent` L58 `mcp__danxbot__link_thread_to_issue` is a LEGIT runtime tool, not a defect. ICE 405 (I5×C9×E9). Carded → CP-41. |
| `plugin-skill-mandate.sh` hook wiring | **Incomplete** | Script header says "Fires on SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit" and has UserPromptSubmit stdin-drain code, but base/hooks.json wires it SessionStart-ONLY (UserPromptSubmit runs inject-time only). The load-first mandate never re-fires per prompt; UserPromptSubmit branch is dead code. ICE 280 (I5×C7×E8). Carded → CP-20. |
| Hook-script behavioral tests | **Incomplete** | Zero tests for the runtime logic of deny-destructive-db / investigation-gate / human-loop-mandate / inject-time. CP-7 validates structure, not behavior. No `.bats` suite exists. Silent-regression risk on safety-critical hooks. ICE 245 (I7×C7×E5). Carded → CP-21 Epic (CP-22 harness+deny / CP-23 gates / CP-24 inject-time). |
| `inject-time.sh` /tmp state cleanup | **Upgradeable** | Writes `/tmp/claude-time-hook-${SID}` per session, never pruned → unbounded accumulation on long-lived hosts/workers. Fix: age-based prune on each fire. ICE 168 (I3×C8×E7). Carded → CP-25. |
| Base mandate-script event-wiring drift (`convey-mandate.sh` + `tool-discipline-mandate.sh`) | **Incomplete** | Both headers claim "Fires on SessionStart AND UserPromptSubmit" (tool-discipline L4-5 even states the intent: reinforce "every session AND every turn so they survive context compression") and both carry a `[ "$EVENT" = "UserPromptSubmit" ] && cat >/dev/null` stdin-drain branch — but `base/hooks.json` wires BOTH SessionStart-ONLY (only `inject-time` fires on UserPromptSubmit). So the designed per-turn reinforcement never happens (decays after compression — the exact failure the header cites) and the drain branch is dead code. Same defect CLASS as CP-20 (plugin-skill-mandate) but DIFFERENT files → not a dup. ICE 280 (I5×C7×E8). Carded → CP-26. |
| Post-DB-migration stale references (db-reset tool ref / marketplace.json desc / safe-terminate pkgs) | **Incomplete** | Three assets still name the RETIRED `danx-issue` MCP + YAML card model (docker-deep L56 "the legacy danx-issue server is gone"; pipe-commit "there is NO YAML file"): `danxbot/skills/db-reset/SKILL.md` L135 calls non-existent `mcp__danxbot__danx_issue_create` (should be `mcp__danx_dashboard__issue_create`); `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` danxbot desc says "issue-card workflow (YAML schema … danx-issue MCP)"; `human-collaboration/skills/safe-terminate/SKILL.md` item 5 lists retired `danx-issue-mcp/` pkg (actual packages/ tree = `danx-dashboard-mcp`). ICE 360 (I5×C8×E9). Carded → CP-34 Epic (CP-35 db-reset / CP-36 marketplace / CP-37 safe-terminate). |
| Root `.gitignore` absent | **Incomplete** | Repo has NO top-level `.gitignore` (only `.danxbot/.gitignore` scoping that subtree); untracked root-owned `claude-projects/` sits uncovered and `git status` is noisy. ICE 270 (I3×C9×E10). Carded → CP-33. |
| Per-plugin CHANGELOG / release notes | **Incomplete** | Distribution is version-driven; autoUpdate swaps the cache on any `plugin.json` bump with ZERO record of what changed. No CHANGELOG at any level; `publish.sh` emits no release notes → consumers get new behavior blind. ICE 150 (I5×C6×E5). Carded → CP-38 Epic (CP-39 gen-changelog.sh / CP-40 publish.sh wiring + README link). |
| MCP tool namespace `mcp__danx_dashboard__` (underscore) | **Complete — NOT a defect** | `danxbot/skills/docker-deep/SKILL.md` L56 authoritatively states the live agent-facing server `@thehammer/danx-dashboard-mcp` has "tools prefixed `mcp__danx_dashboard__`" (underscore), used uniformly across 16+ production skills that demonstrably work. **CP-29's premise (live namespace is the hyphen form `mcp__danx-dashboard__`) is FALSE** — Claude Code sanitizes hyphens in an MCP server name to underscores in the tool prefix. CP-29 should be triaged → Cancel (verified this session via the plugins' own docs + the danx-dashboard-mcp entrypoint). |
| `dispatch-deep/SKILL.md` LOC cap | **Incomplete** | Grew 281→310 lines (DX-1763/DX-1801 "worker-launch footguns" section added 2026-07-08) — breaches the repo's own documented 300-LOC cap (REFACTOR_MATRIX.md L16). Fresh regression this session; CP-8's future validator would have caught it but hasn't landed. ICE 432 (I6×C9×E8). Carded → CP-52. |
| `agent-finalize.sh` exit 66 undocumented in danx-next recovery table | **Incomplete** | Script gained a new terminal exit code 66 (DX-1665 arm b, generation-superseded split-brain fence) fully documented in its own header, but `danx-next/references/step-procedures.md` Step 7a's "Read exit code" list still only enumerates 0/1/2/64/65 — verified via grep, 66 absent. An agent hitting this live code path has no documented recovery step. ICE 504 (I7×C8×E9). Carded → CP-53. |
| `danxbot` skill "Local vs Deployed" table completeness | **Incomplete** | Self-described "single source of truth" quick-reference table lists only `make launch-worker` + `make deploy`/`make publish-mcp` — omits `make launch-worker-host` and the two new DX-1802 remote variants (`launch-worker-remote`/`launch-worker-host-remote`), both already documented consistently in `dispatch-deep` + `no-unauthorized-worker-launch`. Redundancy/completeness gap, not a blocking one (info exists elsewhere). ICE 252 (I4×C7×E9). Carded → CP-54. |

## Section 2: Desired Features (scratchpad)

- **[Carded CP-5] Fix stale README** — Maintenance — 405 (5×9×9) — correct plugin table + install matrix to the real 6 plugins.
- **[Carded CP-7 Epic] Repo integrity gate** — Maintenance — 336 (7×8×6) — Epic (not Feature: server allows `phase_children` ONLY on type=Epic) with children CP-8 (validate script), CP-9 (version-bump check), CP-10 (GitHub Actions CI).
- **[Carded CP-6] Remove stale REFACTOR artifacts** — Maintenance — 243 (3×9×9) — delete/move completed-epic docs from root.
- **[Carded CP-9] Version-bump enforcement guard** — Maintenance — 240 (8×6×5) — child of CP-7.
- **[Carded CP-11] Fix danx-ideate SKILL container doctrine** — Maintenance — 384 (6×8×8) — align step-2 create guidance with container/phase_children-Epic-only rules.
- **[Carded CP-12 Epic] Skill catalog + authoring guide** — Maintenance — 210 (5×7×6) — gen-skill-index.sh (CP-13), commit+README link (CP-14), docs/authoring-plugins.md (CP-15).
- **[Carded CP-16 Epic] publish.sh dry-run + no-op guard** — Maintenance — 196 (4×7×7) — CP-17 --dry-run, CP-18 skip version-only bumps.
- **[Carded CP-19] deny-destructive-db regex gap** — Maintenance — 448 (8×8×7) — add dropAllTables/Views/Types to the PATTERN so code matches its own doc.
- **[Carded CP-20] plugin-skill-mandate SessionStart-only wiring** — Maintenance — 280 (5×7×8) — align header/code/wiring (prefer wiring on UserPromptSubmit).
- **[Carded CP-21 Epic] bats hook test suite** — Maintenance — 245 (7×7×5) — CP-22 harness+deny-db, CP-23 prompt gates, CP-24 inject-time format/state.
- **[Carded CP-25] inject-time /tmp leak** — Maintenance — 168 (3×8×7) — age-based prune of claude-time-hook-* files.
- **[Uncarded] Plugin description single-source-of-truth** — Maintenance — 144 (4×6×6) — reconcile marketplace.json ↔ plugin.json descriptions + drift check; low value, adjacency to CP-8. README `pipeline` row (`flow-*`, "human-in-loop") is stale → flag for CP-5's implementer, not a new card.
- **[Carded CP-26] Base mandate-script per-turn wiring drift** — Maintenance — 280 (5×7×8) — reconcile `convey-mandate.sh` + `tool-discipline-mandate.sh` header/dead-drain-branch vs SessionStart-only `hooks.json` wiring; resolve consistently with CP-20 (same decision: fire per-turn vs align headers down).
- **[Carded CP-27] investigation-gate ↔ human-loop-mandate double-fire** — Maintenance — 144 (4×6×6) — re-confirmed mechanically (run 4): `investigate/scripts/investigation-gate.sh` fires on "why"/"how does"/etc. → gate says load investigate + gather evidence with Bash/Read/Grep; `human-collaboration/scripts/human-loop-mandate.sh` fires on ANY `?` → gate says "STOP all work — no tool calls except Read." A "why…?" prompt injects BOTH, giving opposite tool-permission instructions in the same turn. Both are read-only, so the clash is narrow (read-only Bash/Grep) but real for co-installed human sessions. Carded to force the precedence decision (likely human-loop answer-first wins).
- **[Uncarded] jq/deps preflight for hooks** — Maintenance — ~125 (5×5×5) — hooks assume `jq` present; if missing under `set -euo pipefail` the deny guard may fail-open. Verify Claude Code fail-open/closed behavior first (base:docs-first). Exploratory until confirmed.
- **[Uncarded] Hook invocation-form inconsistency** — Maintenance — ~168 (3×7×8) — `investigate` + `human-collaboration` hooks.json call their scripts by bare path (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/x.sh`, relying on the +x bit) while base/dev/danxbot use `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/x.sh`. Exec bits ARE currently set (100755 in git) so no live bug — purely defensive normalization against a future lost +x bit on the two discipline gates. Below bar given queue depth; fold into CP-8 validate (assert one invocation form) rather than a standalone card.
- **[Exploratory] Split `danxbot` plugin (25 skills)** — Maintenance — not scored/carded — largest plugin; possible sub-plugin split, but big blast radius + unclear payoff. Revisit only when no clearer work remains.
- **[Carded CP-34 Epic] Purge post-DB-migration stale refs** — Maintenance — 360 (5×8×9) — CP-35 db-reset tool ref, CP-36 marketplace.json desc, CP-37 safe-terminate pkg names.
- **[Carded CP-33] Add root `.gitignore`** — Maintenance — 270 (3×9×10).
- **[Carded CP-38 Epic] Per-plugin CHANGELOG** — Maintenance — 150 (5×6×5) — CP-39 gen-changelog.sh, CP-40 publish.sh wiring + README link.
- **[Carded CP-41] Retired `danx_issue_create` in 4 more files** — Maintenance — 405 (5×9×9) — extends CP-34 beyond CP-35's db-reset (lifecycle-states.md, danx-flesh-out overview, no-false-blockers, issue-blocker).
- **[Carded CP-42] deny-db raw SQL table drops** — Maintenance — 392 (8×7×7) — add DROP TABLE / TRUNCATE to PATTERN; implement with CP-19 (same regex line); exclude bare DELETE.
- **[Carded CP-43] inject-time PostToolUse throttle** — Maintenance — 160 (4×5×8) — suppress PostToolUse injection under ~30s delta; keep UserPromptSubmit unconditional.
- **[Uncarded] `argument-hint` frontmatter on 5 SKILL.md** — Maintenance — ~low conf — `argument-hint:` (a slash-command frontmatter key) sits on danx-chat/danx-flesh-out/danx-triage-card/danx-triage-orchestrator/template-app-build SKILL.md; likely ignored by the skill loader. Also non-standard `audience:` on ~6 skills. Uncertain whether these skills double as commands → low confidence; fold into CP-8 validation (assert allowed frontmatter keys) rather than a card.
- **[Uncarded, Dependent] config.yml empty test/lint** — Maintenance — dependent on CP-8/CP-22 — `.danxbot/config/config.yml` declares `commands.test/lint/type_check: ""`, so danx-next Step 5 quality gate runs nothing even once CP-8's validate.sh / CP-22's bats exist. Complements CP-10 (GitHub CI) with the agent-side gate. Card only after CP-8 lands (don't promote a Dependent early).
- **[Verified NOT a defect this run]** — pipeline plugin having ZERO hooks is INTENTIONAL (danx-next step-procedures.md L84 explicitly `/pipe-start`); missing root `.claude/rules/danx-repo-config.md` is MATERIALIZED at dispatch (docker-deep), not committed (CP-31 handles ideator's missing-file fallback); all SKILL.md have name+description; no broken/orphan `references/` links; no real TODO/FIXME; LOC caps hold (max 281 dispatch-deep); `current-time-mandate.sh` header matches its SessionStart-only wiring (unlike CP-20/CP-26).
- **[TRIAGE — CANCEL CP-29]** — the "hyphen namespace" bug is a false positive; underscore prefix is correct per docker-deep L56. Not re-carded (would duplicate/contradict). Flag to operator for Cancel.
- **[Carded CP-44] git-discipline dead `/flow-commit`** — Maintenance — 486 (6×9×9) — rename 3 refs → `/pipe-commit` in dev/skills/git-discipline/SKILL.md + version bump. flow→pipe rename debt fully accounted: README row (CP-5) + this skill; no other dangling flow-* refs (grepped).
- **[Carded CP-45] deny-db docker-volume gap** — Maintenance — 448 (8×7×8) — add `docker compose down -v`/`--volumes`, `docker volume rm`/`prune` to PATTERN; same regex line as CP-19/CP-42; exclude bare `down`. Guard's own REASON/header already promise this route is blocked (doc/code drift).
- **[Uncarded, Exploratory] human-collaboration on autonomous workers deadlocks** — ~120 (5×4×6) — marketplace.json explicitly warns "Do NOT install on autonomous dispatched workers (diagnostic-mode-on-question would deadlock)": human-loop-mandate STOPs on any `?`, so a dispatched worker with no human hangs. Nothing DETECTS/PREVENTS the misconfig. Possible defensive fix: human-loop-mandate.sh no-ops when an autonomous-dispatch env (DANXBOT_DISPATCH_TOKEN / DANX_RUNTIME=container, no human) is detected. Fuzzy detection → low conf; correct install already excludes it. Scratchpad only. DISTINCT from CP-27 (that's investigate↔human-collaboration double-fire in HUMAN sessions).
- **[Note] Divergent ideator memory** — a parallel narrow-scope (ideator-subtree-only) session created CP-28..CP-32 (ideator plugin self-defects) using a SEPARATE clean-room `docs/features.md` that was never merged here. Those cards are real on the board; this canonical file now records them. CP-29 among them is the false positive above.
- **[Carded CP-52]** — dispatch-deep LOC cap breach (310>300) — Maintenance — 432 (6×9×8) — split DX-1763/DX-1801 footguns section into a references/ file.
- **[Carded CP-53]** — agent-finalize.sh exit 66 missing from danx-next recovery table — Maintenance — 504 (7×8×9) — add Exit 66 bullet mirroring existing 0/1/2/64/65 format.
- **[Carded CP-54]** — danxbot skill "Local vs Deployed" table missing launch-worker-host + DX-1802 remote variants — Maintenance — 252 (4×7×9) — add 3 rows, transcribe from dispatch-deep/no-unauthorized-worker-launch.
- **[Note] Board has NO MCP tools this session either** — `mcp__danx_dashboard__*` tools were not present in this dispatch's tool list (same gap CP-28/CP-46/CP-47/CP-48/CP-49/CP-50/CP-51 already describe). Used the documented curl-against-REST-API fallback (session log below has full mechanics). One operational lesson for next session: **the API has no dry-run/validate-only mode** — a test POST to `issue_create` creates a REAL card immediately (learned the hard way this run: an exploratory POST with placeholder description created CP-52 for real; immediately PATCHed it with the full intended content rather than leaving a placeholder card live). Future sessions: compose the FULL description+ac payload before the first POST for a given card; do not "test the shape" with a throwaway body.

## Session Log (overwrite each session)

**2026-07-13 (run 8)** — Board now CP-2..CP-54 (51 cards, up from 50 including the CP-46..CP-51
"ideator has no MCP tools" cluster from a session between run 7 and this one). ALL still at Review —
8 runs in, nothing has EVER moved to ToDo/In Progress. Confirmed again this run: board's derived
status for Review/ToDo/InProgress all return the SAME 50 rows (i.e. literally zero cards in ToDo or
In Progress) — the Review queue remains the sole bottleneck; ideation supply is not.

This dispatch itself hit the exact bug CP-28/CP-46..CP-51 describe: no `mcp__danx_dashboard__*` tools
in the tool list. Worked around via the documented curl-against-REST-API fallback (mechanics below).
Did NOT re-card this — already thoroughly covered by 6 existing Review cards.

Repo source changed materially since run 7 (`cc7dbef`→`148d4a2`, 7 new commits): `base v0.3.23`
(bash-exit-capture redirect-to-file guidance), `danxbot v0.3.96/97/98` (dispatch-deep worker-launch
footguns section, no-unauthorized-worker-launch DX-1802 remote-variant rows, issue-card-workflow
manual-session-finalization section), plus an out-of-band commit to `.danxbot/scripts/agent-finalize.sh`
(DX-1511 worktree-safety `git()` wrapper + DX-1665 arm-b generation-supersede exit 66). Targeted the
diff since run 7 rather than re-sweeping the whole repo (already exhaustively covered 7 times) —
found genuine, fresh regressions/gaps introduced BY that diff:

1. **CP-52** (432, 6×9×8) — `dispatch-deep/SKILL.md` grew 281→310 lines from the new footguns section,
   breaching the repo's own documented 300-LOC cap (REFACTOR_MATRIX.md L16; was clean at 281 per run 7's
   own note). No CI catches this yet (CP-8 still Review) — exactly the risk class CP-7/CP-8 exist for.
2. **CP-53** (504, 7×8×9) — highest-ICE find this run. `agent-finalize.sh`'s new exit code 66 is fully
   documented in the script's own header but ABSENT from `danx-next/references/step-procedures.md`'s
   exit-code recovery table (0/1/2/64/65 present, 66 missing — verified via grep). A dispatched agent
   hitting this live split-brain-fence code path has zero documented recovery step.
3. **CP-54** (252, 4×7×9) — `danxbot` skill's "Local vs Deployed" table (self-described single source
   of truth) omits `launch-worker-host` and the two new DX-1802 remote variants, both already documented
   consistently in `dispatch-deep` + `no-unauthorized-worker-launch`. Lower severity (info exists
   elsewhere) but a real completeness gap in the canonical doc.

Investigated but found CLEAN / no new defect: `scripts/publish.sh` (matches `.danxbot/config/workflow.md`
exactly); `agent-finalize.sh`'s new `git()` wrapper + curl generation-check parsing (correct bash
parameter-expansion for last-line extraction, fail-open branches all correct per its own header);
`deny-destructive-db.sh` PATTERN unchanged (CP-19/42/45 still valid, not re-carded); all hooks.json
files unchanged; no new dead `/flow-*` refs; no new `danx_issue_create` refs; root `.gitignore` still
absent (CP-33 still valid); `REFACTOR_MATRIX.md`/`REFACTOR_PHASE7_REPORT.md` still present (CP-6 still
valid); `docs/skills-index.md` / `docs/authoring-plugins.md` still don't exist (CP-13/14/15 still
valid); all 6 plugin.json versions present and consistent with recent commits; pipeline/dev/investigate/
human-collaboration skill files (least-recently-touched plugins) show no new drift.

**Operational lesson (see scratchpad note above):** the dashboard REST API has NO dry-run/validate-only
mode — a test POST to `issue_create` creates a real card immediately. Learned this the hard way: an
exploratory POST with a placeholder description created CP-52 for real; immediately PATCHed it with the
full intended content (verified PATCH does NOT accept a `board` field in the body — 400 `Unknown
field(s): board` — omit it, board is query-string only for PATCH). Compose the full payload BEFORE the
first POST next time.

API mechanics (reconfirmed + extended this run): auth `Authorization: Bearer $DANXBOT_DISPATCH_TOKEN`
against `$DANXBOT_DASHBOARD_URL`. GET `/api/issues?board=<qualified-id>&status=<Status>` — board in
query, REQUIRED. POST `/api/issues?board=…` with `board` ALSO in the JSON body → **201** with
`{issue:{issue:{id,…}},checklists:...}`. **PATCH `/api/issues/<ID>?board=…`** — board in query ONLY,
including it in the JSON body → 400 `Unknown field(s): board`; `description` and `ac[]` (re-sent) both
update correctly, `ac[]` items keyed by `title`, returns 200 with the full issue + `checklists[]`
reflecting the new AC items. Single-issue GET (`/api/issues/<ID>?board=…`) returns the issue flat (no
`{issue:{issue:{...}}}` nesting — that nesting is POST/PATCH-response-only). `gate_decisions` NOT
required for `Bug`/`Feature` on this board (201 without it, both types this run).

Process note for operator: 51 cards unactioned at Review after 8 ideation runs (some spanning parallel
clean-room sessions — CP-46..CP-51 came from a session this run's log has no direct visibility into).
Marginal value of MORE cards remains near zero — the constraint is entirely TRIAGE + DISPATCH
throughput, not idea supply. This run intentionally used a targeted diff-since-last-run strategy
(rather than a full re-sweep) specifically because 7 prior full sweeps had already exhausted the
low-hanging structural defects; all 3 new cards trace directly to lines added in the 7-commit diff since
run 7, none are re-discoveries.
