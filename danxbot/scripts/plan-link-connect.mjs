// UserPromptSubmit hook — danxbot plugin. DX-2860.
//
// The operator often starts a session by pasting a danxbot plan link, e.g.
// `https://danxbot.sageus.ai/plans/2`. Nothing used to recognise that text, so
// the agent had to work out the connect steps itself — and on 2026-09-15 it
// took ~15 tool rounds to even discover that the title has to come from
// `get_session({session_id:"self"})` (see DX-2858's description for the
// incident this Feature exists to fix).
//
// This hook does exactly one thing: scan the operator's raw prompt TEXT for a
// danxbot plan URL and, if found, inject one short directive telling the
// agent to connect that plan under its own real session title and read
// whatever orientation the connect call hands back. It never calls the
// dashboard itself, never mints or handles any token/credential, and is
// completely silent when no plan URL is present — the connect work and every
// dashboard call still belongs to the agent (via danxbot:plan-workflow), not
// to this hook.
//
// Per CLAUDE.md "Hook scripts must never depend on `jq`": UserPromptSubmit's
// plain stdout is added to the model's context on exit 0 — no JSON envelope
// needed (unlike PostToolUse, see plan-note-reminder.mjs). This hook is a
// plain Node script (not embedded in a .sh wrapper) so its URL-matching logic
// is directly unit-testable, matching plan-note-reminder.mjs's convention.

// is never mistaken for a pasted link. The id is captured; anything after it
