# Flesh-Out — DX-544 Sentinel Detail + Comment Shape

Two details `SKILL.md`'s mechanical gate points here for. Everything else
(in-scope/refuse rules, the workflow steps, the epic/Feature split logic,
boundaries) lives in `SKILL.md` — this file adds no duplicate of any of it.

## DX-544 sentinel-to-review triage stamp

When the sentinel-blocked card's ` start as <Review|ToDo>` token resolves
to `Review` (the card entering Review for the first time), stamp triage
**before** clearing the block and completing: call
`issue_triage({id, confidence, reason})` — a single 0–5 confidence plus a
reason string; the server computes the verdict from board thresholds
(cancel/defer/keep/approve bands) and stamps `ready_at` on approve, or
opens a problem (auto-triage escalation, see `issue-card-workflow`) for a
keep/defer verdict. `triage_expires_at` / ICE / history stamping do not
exist — never a raw write to a `triage{}` object.

Never call this for a card already sitting in Review (out of scope per
`SKILL.md`'s Refuse paths — existing Review cards don't get triaged by
flesh-out) or for a ` start as ToDo` sentinel target (ToDo skips triage).

Then clear the block (`issue_transition({id, action: 'unblock'})`, per
`SKILL.md` step 6) and complete with `danxbot_complete({status: "review"})`
instead of the default `"ready"`.
