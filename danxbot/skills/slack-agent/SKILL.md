# Slack Agent Dispatch — Replying to Slack Threads

If you were dispatched in response to a Slack message, your entire
user-facing output goes through the `danxbot_slack_*` MCP tools. You do
not print answers to stdout for a Slack user to see — there is nobody
reading your stdout. The Slack thread is the only surface the user ever
sees, and the only way to reach it is via the tools below.

**Format the reply text using `base:convey`** — concept-first headline,
caveats list, optional verify pointer. Slack reply budget is **≤12
lines** under convey. Lead with the answer, not the investigation
narrative. This skill owns the *transport contract* (which tool to
call); `convey` owns the *structure of the message text*. Both apply.

**Slack does NOT render GFM/markdown tables.** A `| col | col |` pipe
table posts as literal unreadable pipes — never emit one. For anything
table-shaped use the format rule under *Returning data* below: tiny
structured answers → Slack-native bullets or a `code` block;
list-shaped or many-column data → a file attachment (CSV or other type
fitting the content).

## Editing code in this dispatch → read issue-refs first (DEFAULT MODE)

If this dispatch touches code, the issue-ref comment convention applies exactly as for any agent: before changing a file, `grep -noE '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+'` it for existing card refs and `mcp__danx-dashboard__issue_get({id, fields: ["description", "ac", "comments"]})` each unique id to load the constraint that put the code in its current shape; when YOU make a non-obvious card-driven decision, add a `// <CARD-ID>: <reason>` comment. Full protocol: `danxbot:issue-card-workflow` → "Issue-Ref Comment Protocol".

## Required tool calls

Split by dispatch type:

### Questions — User wants information back

1. **`danxbot_slack_reply`** — REQUIRED. Call after you have finished
   investigating and have a final answer. The `text` parameter IS the
   user's reply; write it as if you are the one person in the thread
   answering their question. Format with Slack mrkdwn (`*bold*` /
   `_italic_` / `\`code\``), keep it focused, and do not hedge with
   meta-commentary like "I'll go check X" — that belongs in a
   `danxbot_slack_post_update`, not the final reply.

2. **`danxbot_complete`** — REQUIRED. Call immediately after
   `danxbot_slack_reply`, with `status: "complete"` and a short
   `summary` (one sentence, for the dispatches dashboard — NOT for the
   Slack user). Never exit without calling this.

### Tasks — Act on a card / do something (do not reply)

1. **`danxbot_slack_reply`** — FORBIDDEN for successful tasks. The 🧠→✅
   reaction (stamped by the listener when `danxbot_complete` exits with
   `status: "complete"`) and the in-place card-view re-render are the
   confirmation. The user sees the card update, not a prose reply.

2. **`danxbot_complete`** — REQUIRED. Always call with `status:
   "complete"` after the task finishes successfully. Never exit without
   calling this.

3. **Failed task** — the ONE task exception that posts a reply. If the
   task fails, post exactly ONE short prose line explaining the failure
   via `danxbot_slack_reply`, then call `danxbot_complete` with `status:
   "failed"` and the failure reason. Coordinate with the listener's own
   failure line (which fires when the dispatch exits non-completed) so
   the two do not duplicate.

## Created or identified a card for this thread → LINK it (MANDATORY)

If this dispatch **creates** an issue card (via
`mcp__danx-dashboard__issue_create`) OR identifies the ONE existing card
this thread is about, you MUST bind the thread to that card:

> `mcp__danxbot__link_thread_to_issue({ issue_id: "<card id>" })`

**Call order is fixed:** `danxbot_slack_reply` (your "Created SO-1 …"
confirmation — this first reply becomes the card-view *message #1*) →
**`link_thread_to_issue`** → `danxbot_complete`. The link slots BETWEEN
reply and complete; it is part of the terminal sequence, not optional
cleanup.

**Why it is mandatory.** The link is what registers the Slack **mirror**:
once bound, every future update to the card (status moves, new comments,
edits) re-renders this thread's card-view message — the card *syncs back
to Slack*. Skip the call and the card still exists and still mirrors to
Trello (that side is automatic, server-side), but the Slack thread is
orphaned: the user sees your one reply and nothing ever again. Creating
a card from a thread without linking it is an incomplete dispatch.

**Rules:**
- **One thread ↔ one card, immutable 1:1.** Link the single primary card
  the thread is about. Thread + channel are implicit from the dispatch —
  you pass ONLY `issue_id`, never a thread/channel.
- A **409** means the thread (or that card) is already linked — that is
  fine, treat it as already-done and proceed to `danxbot_complete`. Never
  try to re-link.
- Created several cards in one thread (e.g. an epic + phases)? Link the
  **one** the thread is primarily tracking (usually the parent/epic, or
  the single card the user asked for).

## Intermediate updates — use sparingly (default: zero for tasks)

**`danxbot_slack_post_update`** posts a status line into the same
thread while you're still working. Use it ONLY for updates the user
cares about:

- "Reading the campaign schema now" — yes (questions)
- "Found the failing test — it's a stale fixture" — yes (questions)
- "Running Read on src/foo.ts" — NO, the user doesn't care
- Any progress-bar-style spam — NO

**For questions:** a good dispatch has zero to two intermediate updates.

**For tasks:** zero intermediate updates is the norm. Post nothing while
working — the action is the answer. Do not post updates for every file
edit or step. If you catch yourself posting, stop — noise erodes trust
and the user will mute the bot.

The canonical pattern is: post one update when you've identified the
investigation plan (questions only), finish the work silently, post the
final `danxbot_slack_reply` (questions only), and `danxbot_complete`.

## Thread scope is automatic

The worker routes every `danxbot_slack_*` call back to the originating
thread (same channel, same `thread_ts`) based on the dispatch row. You
do not pick a thread. You do not pick a channel. If you try to address
a different thread, you can't — the tool has no parameter for it.

## Data questions — query prod read-only by DEFAULT

For a data/lookup question ("what is / how many / show me"), fetch the
rows yourself before you reply. **Which database** you query is decided
by one rule:

| DB | When | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| `prod_db_*` MCP tools | Production data questions — **the default** | read-only |
| local dev DB (repo-native Bash) | You need to **mutate** data to answer — a sandbox experiment, when production data is NOT needed | read-write |

**Production is the default.** Almost every Slack data question ("what
is the status of order X", "how many active suppliers") is answered
against **production** data, read-only, via the `prod_db_*` MCP tools:

- `prod_db_list_tables` — list the tables.
- `prod_db_describe_table` — inspect a table's columns.
- `prod_db_query` — run ONE read-only `SELECT` (SELECT-only,
  single-statement, against a GRANT-SELECT-only replica).

These tools return rows **directly in the tool response** — there is no
file redirect for MCP output — so keep every result set narrow **at the
query**: ask for exactly the rows/columns you need (`LIMIT`, `COUNT(*)`,
specific columns), never a wide `SELECT *` that burns your context.

**`prod_db_*` tools absent → local-only repo.** If your tool list has no
`prod_db_*` tools, this repo has no production DB wired in — local is all
you have, so use the local path below.

**DB unreachable → respond, don't fix.** If the database you need is not
reachable (`prod_db_*` errors out, or the local container is down), reply
**promptly** via `danxbot_slack_reply` that the DB is currently
unavailable, and stop. You do **NOT** diagnose, restart containers, or
repair the system — that is not your job inside a Slack conversation.
DB-up is the assumed normal; a momentary outage is the operator's
concern, not yours to chase down.

### Local dev DB — the mutate-sandbox case (rare)

Reach for the local dev DB ONLY when answering the question requires
**mutating** data — a sandbox experiment where you set up local state,
run code/commands, observe the effect, and production data is not
needed (plus the tool-presence fallback above: a local-only repo with no
`prod_db_*` tools). Your cwd is the connected repo's **full checkout**,
with its own containers and DB, so you query it the way a developer on
that repo would, via Bash.

> **CRITICAL — token conservation (HARD RULE): query/command output ALWAYS goes to a `/tmp/` file, NEVER inline into the tool response.** Every DB query — and any command that could emit more than a few lines — MUST redirect output to a file you name: `… > /tmp/q.json 2>&1`, or the client's own sink (`mysql -e "…" > /tmp/out.tsv`, `psql -o /tmp/r.txt`, `\o /tmp/r.txt`, `COPY … TO '/tmp/x.csv'`). Then read that file ONLY if you actually need a value, and read the **narrowest slice** (`grep`/`head`/a specific key) — never the whole dump. Letting raw rows land in the Bash tool result silently burns thousands of tokens of your context for zero benefit; it is the single most expensive mistake in a dispatch. There is **no "just a quick SELECT" exception** — pipe it to a file. If you only need a count or one field, ask the query for exactly that (`COUNT(*)`, one column) instead of selecting rows you will discard. Same discipline for reading files you wrote: slice, don't slurp.

There is no danxbot DB wrapper tool for this path — three general shapes
(the **exact** compose file, service/container names, and DB engine are
repo-specific — the connected repo's `tools.md`, loaded into your
context, names them; use those, not the placeholders below):

- `docker compose -f <repo-compose> exec -T <db-service> <client> … -e "<SQL>"`
  — exec the repo's own DB container (works host AND docker worker).
- `docker compose -f <repo-compose> exec -T <app-service> <framework-cmd>`
  — drive the app's own framework (e.g. Laravel `php artisan tinker`).
- the DB client directly against the env creds (`DANX_DB_HOST` /
  `DANX_DB_PORT` / `DANX_DB_USER` / `DANX_DB_PASSWORD` / `DANX_DB_NAME`,
  already in your Bash env) when the CLI is on PATH.

Browse the codebase (models, migrations) to learn the schema, then run
the query, **write the results to a file**, reason over them, and reply.
**Always defer to the connected repo's `tools.md` for the real service
names + commands** — it is authoritative for that repo.

**Returning data — NEVER dump raw rows or a GFM pipe-table inline.**
Slack renders neither; both post as unreadable literal text. This is
the single format rule — pick by size and content:

- **Tiny structured answer** (≤ 10 rows AND few columns) → Slack-native
  **bullets** or a fenced **`code` block** in `danxbot_slack_reply({text})`.
  Never a `| … |` pipe table.
- **> 10 rows, OR many columns, OR any list-shaped data** → **attach a
  file**; `text` is a 1–3 line summary, the data rides in the file:
  ```
  danxbot_slack_reply({ text: "47 active suppliers attached as CSV.", files: ["/tmp/suppliers.csv"] })
  ```
  CSV is the default attachment for tabular data; use a different type
  when it fits the content better (e.g. `.json` for nested shapes,
  `.md`/`.txt` for prose, `.sql` for a schema dump).
- **Default to a file attachment** for any list of data unless you have
  a genuinely better tiny view (e.g. a 3-row rollup). A raw inline
  string dump is never the answer — it also blows the ≤12-line reply
  budget above.

The worker uploads the file(s) atomically with the reply text; a
missing/oversized file fails loud back to you as `{error}`. For a prose
answer with no list, just use `danxbot_slack_reply({text})`.

**Build the CSV with a real serializer — never hand-join with commas.**
`awk '{print $1","$2}'` / `sed` / `tr '\t' ','` produce BROKEN CSV: real
values contain commas/quotes (`"Adams, Jaskolski and Howell"`) and a
naive join shifts every column. The DB client's output is tab-separated,
so pipe it through a tool that quotes per RFC 4180 — Python's `csv`
module is always available:

```
… mysql -e "SELECT …" | python3 -c 'import sys,csv; w=csv.writer(sys.stdout); [w.writerow(r.split("\t")) for r in sys.stdin.read().split("\n") if r]' > /tmp/out.csv
```

(or the app framework's CSV writer, e.g. PHP `fputcsv`, which reads
native values — prefer it for fields that may hold tabs/newlines). The
connected repo's `tools.md` has the exact recipe for that repo.

## This is the ONLY path to the user

There is no direct `chat.postMessage`. There is no Bash-to-curl escape
hatch. There is no "reply in stdout and danxbot will forward it." The
`danxbot_slack_*` MCP tools are the only surface the Slack user ever
sees — an agent that prints its answer to stdout and exits went silent
on the user. (Querying the DB is via the `prod_db_*` tools or, for the
local sandbox, plain Bash — those parts work outside the Slack tools.)
